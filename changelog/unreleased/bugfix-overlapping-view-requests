Bugfix: Fix overlapping requests in files app

In some cases the files app tended to display the wrong resources when navigation quickly through the views. This happened because the resource provisioning step wasn't canceld.
This is now fixed by using vue-concurrency which on a high level wraps iterable generators which are cancelable.

It also improves the overall performance for the files app.
